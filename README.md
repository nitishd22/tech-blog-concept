# Tech Blog Concept

## Description

This is a concept of a tech blog that I've created in order to use MVC. Users can make accounts, post, and comment on posts. They also can delete any post or comment.

## Set Up

If downloaded, one will have to:

Initialize
`
npm init
`

source db
`
source db/schema.sql
`

seed the db
`
npm run seed (or whatever your seed script is called)
`

run the project
`
npm start
`
Open at localhost:3000
